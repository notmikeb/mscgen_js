# Source documentation

The source code is organized as straightforward as possible:
- The root contains html (for the [interpreter](index.html), the [tutorial](tutorial.html) and the [embedding sample](embed.html)).
- style sheets go in [style](style)
- libraries in [script/lib](script/lib)
- javascript goes in [script](script)

As the lion's share of mscgen_js is javascript, that part is most heavily documented.
